Portfolio Reflection: Corner Grocer Project
Project Summary and Problem Solved

The Corner Grocer project is a C++ console application designed to analyze daily grocery purchase data for a small grocery store. The program reads item names from an input file and calculates how frequently each item appears using a map data structure. This solves the problem of manually tracking inventory trends by providing a clear, automated way to analyze purchasing patterns. The program also allows users to search for specific items, view all item frequencies, and display a histogram for quick visual comparison.

What I Did Particularly Well

One area in which I performed particularly well was organizing the program into clear, reusable functions. Each major task—loading data, displaying menu options, searching for items, printing frequencies, and generating a histogram—was separated into its own function. This made the code easier to read, debug, and maintain. I also implemented consistent formatting and meaningful variable names, which improved overall code clarity and aligned with industry coding standards.

Areas for Improvement and Future Enhancements

One area where the code could be enhanced is input validation and error handling. While the program handles invalid menu selections, additional validation could be added for file input and user-entered item names. These improvements would make the program more secure and robust by preventing unexpected input from causing runtime issues. Future enhancements could also include sorting the output by frequency or adding support for larger datasets.

Most Challenging Aspects and How I Overcame Them

The most challenging part of the project was working with file input and managing item frequencies using a map. Understanding how to properly read from a file, store data efficiently, and retrieve it accurately required careful testing and debugging. I overcame this challenge by breaking the problem into smaller steps and using documentation and course resources better to understand map behavior and file handling in C++. These tools are now part of my ongoing support network for future programming projects.

Transferable Skills Gained

This project strengthened several transferable skills, including file input/output handling, use of data structures, and modular program design. These skills apply to many future projects and coursework, especially those involving data processing, backend development, and performance optimization. Writing clean, readable code with proper documentation is also a valuable skill in professional software development environments.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

The program was designed with maintainability and readability in mind by using functions, consistent formatting, and descriptive comments. Separating logic into individual functions makes the code easier to update or expand without affecting other parts of the program. This approach ensures that the program can be adapted to new requirements, such as additional menu options or different data sources, with minimal changes.
