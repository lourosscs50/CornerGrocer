A robust, menu-driven C++ console application that analyzes grocery purchase data from a text file, calculates item frequencies, generates a structured output file, and provides interactive data lookup and visualization.

This project demonstrates:

File I/O operations

Associative containers (std::map)

Case-insensitive data normalization

Structured program design

Error handling and validation

Console-based data visualization

The program was designed with maintainability and readability in mind by using functions, consistent formatting, and descriptive comments. Separating logic into individual functions makes the code easier to update or expand without affecting other parts of the program. This approach ensures that the program can be adapted to new requirements, such as additional menu options or different data sources, with minimal changes.
